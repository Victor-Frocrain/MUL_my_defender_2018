HOW TO PLAY

Vikings are trying to invade your castle. You have to protect it the longest as
you can building towers that will attack them.

To build a tower, click on its button and place it on the map. You can place at
most three (3) towers for each type at the same time.

There are four (4) types of towers. Each type has its own properties (life,
damages, attack distances...).

Press Escape to pause the game.
